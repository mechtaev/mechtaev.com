<p>The goal of my research is to automate the development and maintenance of trustworthy software. This encompasses automatically generating code and fixing software bugs, analysing and verifying programs. I focus on addressing practical problems that software developers encounter in real-world projects, often with the aim of making my research directly deployable by practitioners. My work has received prestigious recognition, including the ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Dissertation Award and two ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards. Additionally, the tools I co-developed, such as B-Assist (deployed at Bloomberg) and Angelix (used at IIT Kanpur), have been successfully applied in industry and academy.</p>

<h5 class="border-bottom border-gray pt-2 pb-2 mb-3">Automated Program Repair</h5>

<p>The goal of automated program repair (APR) is to automatically modify a given incorrect program to eliminate the observable failures. APR has recently attracted significant attention from the research community and industry due to abundance of software defects and vulneraries in widely used software, and the significant cost of debugging. This technology can substantially reduce the cost of software debugging and maintenance, and find applications in various areas including software security, developer productivity tools and education. However, its adoption faces technical and societal challenges, such as limited scalability and the lack of developer trust in automatically generated patches.</p>

<p>I led the development of <em>semantic program repair</em> that seeks to address these challenges by using program analysis to understand the meaning of software defects. Early program repair approaches were either purely based on heuristic search, which ignores the semantics of the program and produced low-quality patches, or not scalable. Notably, our tool <a href="../files/icse16.pdf">Angelix</a> was the first semantic approach to scale to large, realistic programs. It uses symbolic execution to infer a specification of the intended behavior, called an <em>angelic forest</em>, and repairs the program according to this specification using program synthesis. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05520.pdf">Later</a>, we discovered that angelic forest can also guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate higher-quality patches. To enhance the developer trust in automatically generated patches, we developed methods to guide program repair by <em>program properties</em>, thus providing stronger guarantees than methods based on tests. Particularly, our tool <a href="../files/fse23.pdf">Symlog</a> is the first general-purpose static program repair framework that is able to repair bugs based on an arbitrary static analysis property expressed in Datalog.</p>
