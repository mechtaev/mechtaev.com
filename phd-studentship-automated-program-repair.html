      <h5 class="border-bottom border-gray pb-2 mb-3">PhD Studentship: Automated Program Repair</h5>

        <p>
          We are looking for talented candidates to pursue a PhD degree in the area of automated program repair in the <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://mechtaev.com">Dr. Sergey Mechtaev</a>.
        
        <p>
          <strong>Research group.</strong> University College London is a <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2019">top university</a>, with one of the <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&world">strongest software engineering research groups</a> in the world. Dr. Sergey Mechtaev is a member of <a href="http://sse.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">Software System Engineering</a> group and <a href="http://crest.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">CREST</a> centre, the developer of <a href="http://angelix.io/">Angelix</a> program repair system, one of the authors of <a href="http://mechtaev.com/publications/phd-thesis.pdf">semantic program repair</a> conception, and an active member of program repair <a href="http://program-repair.org">research community</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Automated program repair.</strong> Software is buggy, and bugs have serious consequences, such as reducing the quality of software products, introducing security vulnerabilities, or even endangering human life. Since bug fixing is a difficult and tedious process, developers often cannot allocate sufficient time and resources to address all problems, and even critical bugs remain unresolved for years. Automated program repair is a rapidly growing area of research that aims to solve this problem by automatically suggesting patches for buggy code, without or with minimal developer involvement. Modern program repair approaches rely on practical techniques from different fields of computer science including program analysis, formal methods and artificial intelligence. Important open problems in program repair include (1) how to automatically address many kinds of defects in large software projects in a scalable fashion, and (2) how to ensure the quality and correctness of automatic patches.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Requirements.</strong> We are looking for candidates who are:
          <ul>
